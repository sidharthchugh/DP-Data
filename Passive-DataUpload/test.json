Screw propellers used in water vessels achieve their efficiency once the screw reaches relatively high speed. This results in negative side effects like cavitation, poor thrust at low propeller speed, noise and impacts the surrounding ecosystem. Slowing the screw propeller down reduces cavitation and therefore noise but also reduces thrust. Diver Propulsion Vehicles and LDUUV drones with screw props have poor agility with cargo and cannot carry as much of equipment as they could (sensors, equipment, tools) also they provide limited  access to protected zones which makes research difficult. NOA DRIVE enables the crafts to have: lower energy demand when transporting cargo, high thrust at low propeller speed, huge payload capacity, low noise and access to protected environments.
