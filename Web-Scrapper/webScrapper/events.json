It has advantages in terms of costs and flexibilty when compared to traditional injection molding process (MIM) and Selective laser melting, and there is a lot of interest for it in the \u201cErsatzteil\u201d industy.

Combined with our previous experience in debinding & sintering in the ceramic industry we are confident that we will successfully solve this problem. Such an innovation in FDM printer technology will open up the market for 3D printers, aiding the business for a number of filament producers and desktop printer manufacturers in Europe.
